While convenient, they aren't as writer friendly as reference or implicit links.This is an example of using **reference** links to sites like [Google][1] or my blog, [SavageLook.com][2].  These links make the paragraph more readable.  Numbers are used here for reference ids, but any string value can be used.  The reference ids can be defined anywhere in the markdown.  In this case they are found at the end of this section.This is an example of using **implicit** links to sites like [Google][] or my blog, [SavageLook.com][]. These are the easiest to read.  The text of the link is used as the link id, just like a reference link.This is an example of using **automatic** links to sites like <http://www.google.com> or my blog, <http://savagelook.com/blog>. This is a shortcut syntax for quickly adding links that can be displayed as is.  They also work for email addresses, <nobody@nobody.com>.[1]: http://www.google.com[2]: http://savagelook.com/blog[Google]: http://www.google.com[SavageLook.com]: http://savagelook.com/blog "Optional Title"******************************# ImagesJust like links above, images can be specified with inline, reference, or implicit declarations.![Alternate text for inline image](http://www.google.com/images/logos/ps_logo2.png) ![Alternate text for reference image][ImageId]![ImageId][][ImageId]: http://www.google.com/images/logos/ps_logo2.png
